## What is 100Devs?

100Devs is a diverse and inclusive community of 1000s of participants in a training program run by [Leon Noel](https://leonnoel.com/). It is 100% free and requires absolutely no previous technical experience. 

As Leon says, 'this is not a tech bootcamp, this is a how to get a job bootcamp'. While the course does teach the necessary technical skills to ge a job as a full stack developer, it is unique because it also covers networking, resumes, job applications, the interview process, and freelancing. Even if you are already technically proficient but you are struggling to find a job, you will find value here.


## How does it work?

Live classes are streamed on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/learnwithleon) Tuesdays and Thursdays and office hours (review classes) are streamed on Sundays. Recordings of all classes are available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBf-QcbaigsJysJ-KFZvLGJvvW-3sfk1S), however, office hours (which are not essential) are only on Twitch and are deleted after 60 days. Follow along materials are available on the [Discord](https://leonnoel.com/discord) and there are some community-made resources as well (see below). Homework is assigned at the end of each class, some of which should be submitted.

The material is self-paced. Although it's called the Catchup Crew, your goal is not to catch up to live classes. This is a significant time investment and you should give yourself the time and space to complete it according to your schedule and your constraints. 

The material is also self-directed. You get out what you put in, and that means you need to have a certain amount of focus and self-motivation to be successful. Having said that, we are community-taught and community-supported. Join the [Discord](https://leonnoel.com/discord), find [#100Devs on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100Devs). If you're struggling, if you need help, if there's something you can't figure out, ask! There is always someone around who's willing to lend a hand.


## How do I get started?

The classes are on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBf-QcbaigsJysJ-KFZvLGJvvW-3sfk1S) and the follow along materials and homework assignments are available on the [Discord](https://leonnoel.com/discord). Tracking the classes and materials from Discord can be difficult, though, so I would recommend you check out these community-made resources to make the process easier (there are a few others but these are the ones that are up to date):

- [100Devs Follow Along](https://100devsfollowalong.netlify.app/): Class videos and links to slides and class/homework materials. Updates when the videos are uploaded on Youtube. As of Sept 12, up to date until class 47 (latest on Youtube).
![100Devs Follow Along Screenshot](follow-along.png)

- [100 Devs Homework Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/177Ls9QS5ryjPBi82cjDnbtse5Of0RFl8/edit): A Google Docs version. No links to materials, but does have classes and homework. As of Sept 12, completely up to date and includes time-sensitive Huntober deadlines.
![100 Devs Homework Checklist](homework-checklist.png)

- [100 Devs Homework Tracker](https://labrocadabro.github.io/100devs-hw-tracker/): A web-based tool (made by me!) that focuses specifically on homework tracking. Contains links to relevant homework materials but no classes or class materials. As of Sept 12, completely up to date but does not include Huntober deadlines.

- [Leon Stream Scripts](https://leonstreamscripts.herokuapp.com): searchable Youtube subtitles. Extremely useful when you remember something was mentioned but you forget which class.

And join the [Discord](https://leonnoel.com/discord)! There are so many people there willing to help with any questions you have, big or small.


## Am I too late? Should I wait for the next cohort?

The first cohort was conducted in 2021; we are currently nearing the end of the second cohort. However, you're not too late! New people are joining every day, and Leon is working on systems to ensure that we can complete the course even after live classes have ended. As far as the next cohort goes, Leon has said he would like to do another, but nothing has been confirmed yet.


## How do I join a house?

Originally there were houses for different levels of commitment to the program, but this cohort exploded in popularity and the houses were dropped early on. 


## How do I find an accountability buddy or study group?

Check the Catchup Crew channel on Discord, every 2-4 weeks someone makes a new study group for members who have recently joined. If there's no recent group, go ahead and make one and invite others to join!

There is also the [Catchup Crew Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oZRvtvaP6AF0sxAn4dMZoDgR0AEntQvR0zJhNTixNhc/edit#gid=0) to keep track of where people are in the program, but it requires people to manually update as they progress, so it may not be accurate.


## Should I check in on Twitter for classes that happened months ago?

Yes. Check in for each class as you watch it. It's one of the requirements that will be checked when you're looking for work and you'd like a verification or reference from Leon.


## I'm doing all the homework, but should I submit it? Will anyone check it?

Yes, you should submit it. No one is going to look at it and give you feedback, but as with checking in, it's one of the requirements for verification down the line. Do keep in mind that while your homework won't be checked when you submit it, there's a good chance Leon will look at if you ask for verification. 


## I need solutions for XX homework. Where can I find them?

Most homework does not have provided solutions. If you build something and it looks/works the way you want it to, you did it right. If you can't figure out how to get something to work, ask for help!  


## I already know XX. Should I start from Class 1? Can I get verified if I don't do all the classes?

I personally think it's worth starting from the beginning, even if you have some experience already. If you decide to start from the beginning but some material is familiar, you can watch classes on 1.5x or 2x, or skip sections you don't need. But it's not necessary to do so, the choice is yours. You can still get verification if you don't do the early homework; Leon annouced a clean slate in class 32, so anything you missed before that will be forgiven.

If you already know some topics well, you can skip the earliest classes. A popular entry point in that case is the [Javascript Super Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkXLGS57MS4) (class 18). 

If you are only looking for job hunting/freelancing advice, you can skip most of the classes, but you won't be able to get verification. Classes relevant to job hunting:

- [9: Networking Nght](https://youtu.be/OaglXfjsBaE)
- [15: How to Start Freelancing](https://youtu.be/OaglXfjsBaE)
- [25: Fix Your Resume](https://youtu.be/ZlB4BockYNQ)
- [33: Secrets to Landing Your First Tech Job](https://youtu.be/lIE1LFz4LJM)
- [34: Crush Your Technical Interviews](https://youtu.be/lIE1LFz4LJM)

These are the dedicated classes, but not the only ones that cover job-related topics. For other mentions, you can check the [searchable subtitles](https://leonstreamscripts.herokuapp.com).


## I missed some of the early check-ins or homework, do I need to go back and do them?

Leon announced a fresh start in class 32, so anything you missed before then, you don't have to go back and do. However keep in mind that: 

1. the course is completely free and takes a significant amount of effort on Leon's part
2. he asks you to check-in to help increase the reach of the course
3. the homework is your skills training, so even if you don't submit it you should still do it


## Where are the missing classes?

Some classes aren't on Youtube. This is because they weren't regular classes. If you see that a class is missing, you can just move on to the next one; you haven't missed anything.

- Class 17: Networking Night
- Class 18: Project Night
- Classes 42 & 43: Welcome Back sessions after a long break
- Class 48+: Not yet on Youtube
- Class 49: Catchup for Huntober Prep Work


## I'm stuck on the readings! How do I get through them?

Some of the readings can be dense and everything you absolutely need to know is covered in class, but Leon assigns everything for a reason. The reading helps you get some familiarity with the concepts before Leon teaches them. And probably more importantly, on the job you will probably be required to read documentation, so you do need to get used to parsing technical language. 

However, that doesn't mean you need to understand every single point that's covered. Read to get a basic understanding and move on. And if you're getting completely derailed by the reading and you've been stuck on it for weeks, move on and make a note to revisit it later when you're more familiar with the concepts.


## I'm stuck on floats! Can I just use Flexbox and Grid instead?

Similar to the readings, Leon assigns everything for a reason. There is legacy code out there still using floats, because Flexbox and Grid weren't always well supported. You really should have at least a basic understanding of how they work.

And similar to the readings, don't spend too much time on floats. You probably won't actually use them all that much, and if you're stuck to the point you can't move on, it's better to take another look at them after you've learned more.


## How do I put my Codewars katas on Github?

Create a private repository just for Codewars. The most common method is a to create a new file for each kata you complete, and paste your solution in it when you complete the kata.

For example, my directory structure looks like this:

![my codewars directory structure, organized by language then kyu](codewars-organization.png)

Rufio (a member of the Stream Team) also has a video on her [codewars workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HazQz4qosR4).


## I have old katas I didn't upload to Github. How do I backdate git commits?

Rufio has two videos you can check out, one on her [entire codwars workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HazQz4qosR4) and one on [how to backdate commits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFRY6Gxw9EA).


## How do I get Github green squares for private repositories?

Go to your profile and find your contribution graph. In the top right, there's a dropdown that says 'Contribution settings'. From there make sure 'Private Contributions' is checked.
